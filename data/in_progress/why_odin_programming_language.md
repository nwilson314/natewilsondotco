# Why I'm Obsessed with the Odin Programming Language

*Quick note: the original version of this was AI generated when I needed some dummy posts to test this website's layout. BUT it's an interesting topic and I had some thoughts so decided to rewrite it for real.*

Ok, "obsessed" is a pretty strong word. BUT the reality is that, after about 3 years of tinkering with Rust, I have fully invested in learning and using Odin for game dev side projects.
