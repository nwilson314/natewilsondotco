					I build software that doesn't suck. Currently doing healthcare APIs at Prevounce Health - lots of Python, React, 
					and the occasional fire drill that comes with the territory of building complex systems.

						When I'm not debugging someone else's brilliant ideas, I'm training for triathlons (just finished Ironman Ohio 2025 - barely), 
						reading Sanderson novels at unhealthy speeds, or fixing things around our farm. There's something therapeutic about 
						both untangling code and untangling actual wires.

						<strong>Prevounce Health</strong> - Building their API platform and developer tools. Python/FastAPI backends, 
						React frontends, lots of AWS infrastructure. Healthcare data is surprisingly complex and surprisingly fragile.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Previously:</strong> Skipper Hospitality (booking platform chaos), HealthCrowd/mPulse Mobile 
						(healthcare communication systems). Each place taught me something different about how software 
						actually gets used in the wild.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Education:</strong> Started with electrical engineering at Ohio State (hardware is hard), 
						then pivoted to a master's in computer science at Northeastern (software is also hard, just differently).

			<div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
				<p>
					I like building things that just work. Not in a perfectionist way, but in a "people can actually use this 
					without pulling their hair out" way. Most of my time is spent figuring out why something broke, how to make 
					it not break again, and occasionally building something new from scratch.
				</p>
				<p>
					The best part of this job is when you write some code and it actually solves someone's real problem. 
					Maybe it saves them time, maybe it prevents errors, maybe it just makes their day a little less frustrating. 
					That's what keeps me interested in all this.
