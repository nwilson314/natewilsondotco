# Personal Website & Digital Garden

This very website! Built as a personal project to create a professional online presence and experiment with modern web technologies.

## What I Built

- **Clean, responsive design** with full dark mode support
- **Blog system** with markdown content management
- **Project showcase** with filtering and categorization
- **Contact forms** and professional information
- **Performance optimized** with SvelteKit's SSG capabilities

## Technical Challenges

The most interesting challenge was implementing a proper dark mode system with Tailwind CSS v4. The new architecture required custom variant definitions and careful state management across components.

## What I Learned

Working with SvelteKit's newest features (Svelte 5 runes) while building a real-world application gave me great insight into the framework's evolution and capabilities.

The dark mode toggle was particularly challenging, requiring custom Tailwind CSS variants and careful state management across components.
