# What's this about?
Recently, I have found myself becoming a bit stagnant in my work/career.  

The truth is that I am still quite early in my CSE career (despite being in my mid-30's) and while I find my day job to be quite stimulating, it is rather narrow in focus (primarily backend web development). For one, there's this whole AI/gen-AI thing going on (perhaps you've heard of a thing called ChatGPT) that I am not being exposed to during the course of my day-to-day (other than using it cursorily) due to the fact that my company just doesn't use it (and by exposed I am talking purely from a technical level). Secondarily, I just have a lot of things that I am interested in: some side web app projects/ideas, game programming, compilers/interpreters. I find genuine enjoyment out of programming and thinking through projects.

And none of this is even mentioning that my "hard" CS knowledge gathering has tapered off a bit since obtaining my masters.

So this is how I find myself in a place where I'm interested in a self-directed CS course for continuing my education in the field. This way, I can more formalize the random tinkering and half projects that I seem to start and stop on a whim constantly and direct that energy into "bettering myself" (or at least expanding my knowledge domain).

My first observation was that I don't have to go it alone. There are A LOT of resources out there. In fact, here's a link to everything I've found: (resource link to follow). People are interested in learning apparently. However, a lot of what was there seemed rather focused on the more traditional CS lecture style and something more akin to a standard university degree. I have this already and I wasn't interested in going back to that, at least fully. So instead, I have attempted to curate a more project focused education. It's what I find more interesting, and, frankly, what I think people can learn best from. Doing something solidifies understanding in a way that just reading/watching/listening just doesn't.

The below list isn't hard and fast. I will likely deviate quite a bit. I'm also including some other ideas that I had that I don't plan on following through with but that I thought someone might enjoy. Even further, there are likely topics that some might not consider "worthy" of focusing on as a good software developer. That's fine! As I mentioned, this is half for me to have fun learning about things I am interested in (with a loosely wrapped formalized process).

I'll also be taking any suggestions or follow-ups from people should they have any. Just reach out to me on Twitter (either DMs or otherwise).

# The Curriculum 
## Explained
I went through a few different iterations and false starts. As I mentioned above, there are an enormous (and even overwhelming) amount of resources for teaching yourself computer science. Some better than others. I eventually found the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) (TYCS) curriculum and it immediately resonated with me. For one, I realized that because I have had a slightly non-traditional path through CS, I did not receive as much of a formal education in some key CS topics. TYCS, to me, felt like it could fill in those holes while also being relatively straightforward. Even poking around a bit, I found that the resources were all what they claimed to be: the best book and/or video per topic (often with some alternatives). Moreover, I enjoyed that it was relatively streamlined.

Now, that said, I am not going to follow it to the T (tea, tee?). Instead, I am going to modify the topics slightly and expand to some others that I think are important to learn. My goal here is more "masters" level than undergrad, even if some of the gaps in my knowledge probably are undergraduate level. Additionally, I am going to tailor the experience to be more project oriented. In some cases, the chosen course might get me there. In others, I might have to create my own or borrow elsewhere.

As mentioned above, the list may change over time.

## Alternatives
Through searching for reasonable curriculums, I came across a few that might be of interest. I'm including them here as a reference (and will likely steal pieces). The full details are below in the [Appendix](#alternative-curriculums).

- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com)
- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## The Real Thing
I'm going to break this down into some high level topics that are then completed separately as a course. I'm not going to go into extensive detail about each (mostly because I am building it out as I go). But the general idea is to produce *something* at the end of each "course" (and hopefully a couple of somethings). 
## Topics

1. Computer Architecture
    - A programming oriented cut of architecting programs for the hardware systems they are operating on
    - Go through topics from data representation to CPU design and caching
2. Algorithms & Data Structures
3. Math for CS/ML
4. Operating Systems
5. Computer Networking
6. Web Development & Browser Architecture
7. Databases
8. Compilers & Interpreters
9. Distributed Systems
10. LLM & AI Systems

## A Note About AI
One quick aside: AI is your friend in this. I have some high level ideas about what I want to learn, what topics, but sometimes it is hard for me to structure a "course" out of each topic, including projects. This is where AI can really help give some structure. And probably even more importantly, tailor it to your specific knowledge and/or interests. 

## Timeline
As outlined, this curriculum will take about a 1.5-2 years part-time. If you're someone that has a lot of free time on your hands, this plan can be done in something like 6 months (and you'll likely hate yourself at the end of it). I'm going to strive for something in the middle, shooting for about a year. I do have something of a life after all (and a day job besides).

This is often the hardest part. Well, at least for me it is. Often I find that when I am up against the realities of how time works, I get impatient and give up. You can't just learn things overnight (despite what a bunch of people on the internet will tell you). Sure, it is easy to get a high level understanding in like 2 weeks of dedicated learning on just about any topic. The goal of this curriculum is not to get a high level understanding, but a true understanding. The goal is to get cracked (as the kids are calling it these days). 

So yes, you might feel like waiting 6-12 months to start digging in on ML/AI is going to put you behind. But the reality is, you might just be behind already because you don't fully understand the core concepts (like I am). Jumping to the end isn't going to fix your issues. I have to tell myself this A LOT. But it is a lesson that I have learned the hard way over the years. Honestly, I truly believe that there are so many "engineers" out there that don't know the basics that if you do actually show up with a solid foundation, you're going to seem like a damn wizard.

AI is eating the world, but not yet. In the meantime, take the time to learn why.

# Appendix
## Alternative Curriculums

- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com)
	- IMO the current best undergraduate level CS overview.
	- It's a good middle ground between covering enough of the important topics while not being so much that it would literally take you 4 years to complete.
	- If I was attempting to be a self-taught CS engineer, this is what I would go with.
	- It's not actually project focused though. This in particular was why I found it to be more of a guide than an actual curriculum to follow (though obviously YMMV).
	- I guess one more bullet to add... it is not actually all that structured. Which is nice in some ways, but if you actually have no idea what you are supposed to learn then it's likely that the OSSU might be a better option.
- [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)
	- There's a lot here. If you follow their advice and go through the Core + some electives in the Advanced section, you may be doing it for 2-3 years. Obviously, if you don't have a job this may be able to be shortened, but for my purposes there was too much.
	- It's broken down in a very step-by-step way that might be nice for someone that doesn't want to have to tailor their own experience. I find this to be too rigid, but for someone that is purely self-taught, this might be an advantage.
	- That said, I found that much of the curriculum is "solid" though a bit light on books (which is a preferred way of learning for myself)
	- Again, not actually project focused.
- [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)
	- I found this years ago when I was first getting into CS. It's not really a replacement for an undergrad degree. As the title suggests, it is geared toward getting a job, and is more of a repository of data structures and algorithm resources.
	- However, there are a lot resources here that an aspiring undergraduate level CS student should learn. The emphasis for this "course" is data structures and algorithms which isn't ALL that comprises CS, but it is much of what modern CS jobs require when job seeking (though I am finding that AI has been changing this paradigm somewhat).
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
	- I would be remiss if I did not include Free Code Camp.
	- As the name suggests, it is more akin to a coding bootcamp rather than a formal CS degree. Going through FCC purely will probably mean you'll end up as a Type 2 engineer (from TYCS, this is an engineer that stays surface level on all topics), at least initially.
	- However, I think one thing that it is exceptional at is building out programming knowledge via projects. Which is, IMO, the absolute best way of learning. 
	- One other (small downside) is that FCC is primarily focused on web development. The vast majority of jobs are in this realm so it may seem that this is a strength, but there's a lot of the hardcore CS topics that are glossed over by JS (and Python which is the other language that FCC has made courses with).
	- FCC might be a good place to start, get your feet wet, and then come back to some of the others above to learn more "hard" CS knowledge. Or even go through them concurrently.
